# Personal Website

This project is my personal website developed using Create React App and a few others.

It's been a bit since the last time I've played with React so figured what better opportunity to dive back in then getting creative with a personal website. The site has also been designed and mocked in Figma.

This project is still a work in progress and do intend on implementing additional features. That list of features is somewhere in the back of my head at the moment.

You can take a look at the site [here](https://petermorrison.info).
